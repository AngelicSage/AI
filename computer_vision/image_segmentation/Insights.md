# I used PointRend for this project
### In my approach, everything not segmented was turned gray

### Point sampling helps bring back the colors of the image:

## Then I decided to take an approach with a funny dog picture
### crocs is included as part of the dog's body, but still acknowledged as didfferent

## Final product misclassifies image as a cat
Pointrend is most likely not trained on funny dog pictures
